# That Guy Boilerplate

That Guy Boilerplate is a modified version of HTML5 Boilerplate. That Guy
assumes you will have a header and footer that are standard throughout the
site. To this end, it uses PHP includes to minimize the editing needed.
There are also several other improvements added to the default HTML5
Boilerplate including an @font-face template for custom fonts, some slight
re-arrangement of directory structure, and other small additions and changes.
